# Search For User Authentication Tree Node

A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's Identity Platform 5.5 and above. This node searches for a user based on a set of configurable user search profile attributes. 

## Installation

Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
## Usage

Deploy the node and set the configuration as appropriate. Set 'sharedStateAttribute' to the name of the shared state attribute which holds the value to search for (default: username). Set 'datastoreAttributes' to the set of user profile attributes to search. For example, to allow a user to login using either username, email adress, or their full name, add "uid", "mail", and "cn".

Wire the outcomes as appropriate. Where a search results in multiple matching user profiles, the outcome "ambiguous" is generated. 

## To Build

The code in this repository has binary dependencies that live in the ForgeRock maven repository. Maven can be configured to authenticate to this repository by following the following [ForgeRock Knowledge Base Article](https://backstage.forgerock.com/knowledge/kb/article/a74096897).

Edit the necessary SearchForUserNode.java as appropriate.  To rebuild, run "mvn clean install" in the directory containing the pom.xml
